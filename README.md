This started out as a second semester APCSA (AP Computer Science A) project but slowly evolved into something bigger. I started working on this aat the end of semester 2 but continued to develop it throughout summer. The end goal is to have a polished product that truly helps to change the way we take roll and keep track of attendance (and more) in school.
